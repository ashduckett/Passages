Principles

Pricing

We don't do overcharging, that's not what makes a company popular. We don't charge for our passion either, what you pay for is our
time. If you're a charitable organisation, there's a good chance we'll lend our services for a good cause. If you have a brief, send it over and we'll get back to you within 24 hours with a quotation.

Charity

We aren't the budget option because we're better than that. If you are a charity, however, and require assistence, we pride ourselves
on doing good and will be happy to help.

Working Hours

We don't work nine until five because that way of working isn't what inspires us. In order to be creative we often have to go outside to learn and research. That said, we are available to contact 24 hours a day online and from nine until five by telephone.

Inspiration

The sword is mitier than the pen, and we believe that ideas bring about words, words bring about ideas, and ideas, my friend, are bullet proof. Writing with thought can change your business or charity. It can make or break it so let us do the heavy lifting.
